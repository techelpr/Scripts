This is a home for all of my scripts that I have made.

Some of these are pointless in that it would be faster to just do manualy but regardless, it is what it is.

If you find these scripts handy, feel free to use them and adapt them as you like.

They arn't here with the intention that anyone but myself will use them, so they may be underdeveloped by some standards.

Anyway, enjoy!
